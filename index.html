Technically, they’re not the oldest if you count the ones I made in Scratch. The oldest functional game I made was called Parkour Teleport, which I created in Roblox. Like many of my projects, I abandoned it when a more exciting idea came along.  </p>

                        <p class="downBarBarText">I saw Sebastian Lague's video about making procedural planets, and that made me want to create a game about interstellar procedural automation with my own code that generates planets. Of course, the project was too complicated for my limited knowledge and my limited age, so I never finished it. The code was very math-intensive and not very good. The finished product wasn’t good, but I learned a lot about models in 3D graphics, and the fact that I managed to do anything is a relatively good achievement because, in school, we didn’t even take Pythagorean theorem. In that code, there are sine, cosine, and other concepts I hadn’t learned in school for at least five years, along with complicated math.</p>

                        <p class="downBarBarText">After failing to complete Planetarium, where I learned little from taking on an overly complicated project, I decided to start another game. This time, with a friend, we aimed to create a procedurally generated 3D realistic automation game where players progress through different technological ages of human civilization. However, we never finished it. Later, I returned to the project and, instead of simplifying its massive scope, decided to make the game take place on a large planet instead of a flat, infinite space like Minecraft. I even created a new spherical planet generation code, but after some progress, I abandoned the project again afeter few months.</p>
